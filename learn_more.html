          Receiving a diabetes diagnosis can be one of the stressful moments in your life. Our team's goal
          is to reduce your or a loved one's stress as much as possible by minimizing the amount of work that you have
          to do in order to learn about this lifelong illness.

            <summary>What are the types of diabetes?</summary>
            <p>Type 1 diabetes: Occurs when there is an insulin shortage in the body due to the immune system
                attacking insulin producing cells in the pancreas.<br>
                Type 2 diabetes: Occurs when the body cannot either produce enough insulin or use it properly, typically
                due to either insulin resistance or Î²-cell dysfunction.

            <summary>What is insulin resistance?</summary>
            <p>Insulin normally tells the liver to stop making sugar (or glucose) when there is already enough present in the blood. 
                However, when the liver becomes insulin resistant, it doesn't properly respond to the signal insulin sends. 
                This specifically impairs the function of diacylglycerol (DAG) activation in the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. 
                The disablement of one lipid molecule, in one specific pathway, causes a domino effect of dysregulation of other important 
                signaling pathways within the liver. The liver will continue to make glucose and release it into the blood, even when 
                it's not supposed to. This causes blood sugar levels to rise (leading to hyperglycemia).</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What is Î²-cell dysfunction?</summary>
            <p>Î²-Cells are found in the pancreas and are responsible for producing, storing and releasing  insulin. This 
                mechanism begins when glucose enters the Î²-Cell. The Î²-Cell processes the glucose as energy to then set 
                off a chain reaction which ultimately leads to the release of insulin. If there is a malfunction within 
                the Î²-Cells, the reaction does not happen, and insulin is not released, causing blood sugar levels to 
                remain high. Over time, the lack of insulin production contributes to the development and progression of 
                type 2 diabetes.</p>

            <summary>What are common tests for diabetes?</summary>
            <p>
                A1C test: The one of the most common and practical test for diabetes. It measures your average blood glucose
                for the past two to three months. You are diagnosed with diabetes at a level of 6.5% or higher.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) test: This test measures your blood glucose levels after you have fasted,
                so you cannot eat nor drink anything for 8 hours before this exam. You are diagnosed with diabetes at a
                level of 126 mg/dl or higher.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): This test gives you a sweet drink and measures their blood glucose
                levels before and after two hours. You are diagnosed with diabetes at a level of 200 mg/dl or higher.
            </p>
            <p>
                Random / Causal Plasma Glucose Test: This test is simply a random test of your blood glucose levels at
                any point in the day, no matter if you have or have not eaten or drinken anything. Typically, this test
                is only administered if you already have other diabetes symptoms. You are diagnosed with diabetes at
                a level of 200 mg/dl or higher.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What is Type 2 Diabetes?</summary>
            <p>Type 2 diabetes affects how the body processes blood glucose. It's linked to insulin resistance and often preventable with lifestyle changes.</p>
